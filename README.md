# SelecSortThreaded
Hello my name is Aleksandr Skidelskiy. This is my threaded selection sort project from Fall semester of 2015. 
The goal of this small project was to show knowledge on how to create and utilize a thread and use them for sorting. I've also added visualization for some eye candy.
Selection Sort was part of the project requirement.
